#Sudoku Solver

This was a project for my Programming Languages course (Spring 2014).
It compiles, but runs out of memory during the recursive portion. I'm
pretty sure the problem could be solved by forcing tail recursion, but
there may be other issues as well.

This remains as an unfinished project.
